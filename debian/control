Description: Package for comparing Go values in tests (library)
 Package for equality of Go values GoDev
 (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp) Build Status
 (https://travis-ci.org/google/go-cmp)
 .
 This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to
 reflect.DeepEqual for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.
 .
 The primary features of cmp are: • When the default behavior of
 equality does not suit the needs of the test, custom equality functions
 can override the equality operation.  For example, an equality function
 may report floats as equal so long as they are within some tolerance
 of each other.• Types that have an Equal method may use that method
 to determine equality.  This allows package authors to determine the
 equality operation for the types that they define.• If no custom
 equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined, equality is
 determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both values,
 much like reflect.DeepEqual. Unlike reflect.DeepEqual, unexported fields
 are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed
 by using an Ignore option (see cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported) or explicitly
 compared using the AllowUnexported option.  See the documentation
 (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp) for more information.
